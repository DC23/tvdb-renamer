`Bumpversion <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion>`_ is used to manage the
package version numbers. This ensures that the version number is correctly
incremented in all required files. Please see the bumpversion documentation for
usage instructions, and do not edit the version strings directly.

Version numbers follow the `Semantic versioning guidelines <semver.org>`_.
